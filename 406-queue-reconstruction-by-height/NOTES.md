**Main idea is**: For taller people it doesn't matter at all where shorter people stands! That is, taller people can line up without thinking about shorter people.
​
​
So, first taller people line up in the queue and then when a short person comes, he goes to his appropriate place that is (k + 1)th place in the queue. And this is very similar to how insertion sort works!
